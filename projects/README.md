# Awesome Radical Decentralization Projects

## General

### [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/)

We’re developing open source industrial machines that can be made for a fraction of commercial costs, and sharing our designs online for free. The goal of Open Source Ecology is to create an open source economy – an efficient economy which increases innovation by open collaboration.

## Food

### [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/)

Humanity's open-source automated precision farming machine.

## Mesh Networking

### [CJDNS](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns)

An encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.

## Internet Protocols

### [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page)

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers.

### [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.org/introduction.html)

BitTorrent gives you the same freedom to publish previously enjoyed by only a select few with special equipment and lots of money. ("Freedom of the press is limited to those who own one" — journalist A.J. Liebling.)

#### [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/intro)

WebTorrent is the first torrent client that works in the browser. It's easy to get started!

### [Dat](https://docs.datproject.org/)

Dat is a nonprofit-backed data sharing protocol for applications of the future.

### [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro)

I2P is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other. The network itself is strictly message based (a la IP), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (a la TCP). 

### [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

### [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid)

Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.

### [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/)

a decent(ralised) secure gossip platform

### [The Onion Router](https://www.torproject.org/)

Anonymity Online: Protect your privacy. Defend yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis.

## FileSharing

### [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/)

OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size.

## Social Networks

### [Patchbay](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay)

The goal is to make a client developers love - it comes with social views, as well as chess, book reviews, and some git interface.

### [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork)

A decentralized messaging and sharing app built using patchcore. The goal is to make a standalone, easy to install, "social" view into the SSB world.

## Hosting

### [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/)

Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser with tools to create and host websites. Don't just browse the Web, build it.

### [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/)

Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.

### [TickTack](https://github.com/ticktackim/ticktack-workplan)

A blog publishing app for long-form articles. Also has private messaging integrated.

## Developer Tools

### [git-ssb](https://git-ssb.celehner.com/%25n92DiQh7ietE%2BR%2BX%2FI403LQoyf2DtR3WQfCkDKlheQU%3D.sha256)

A totally decent git interface. Familiar interface for raising issues, forking, opening pull requests. News about projects of friends, or people you follow.
